These are all of the exercises I've coded (either along with, or alone as an exercise) for The Web Developer Bootcamp, taught by Colt Steele. I've found it extremely informative and the method in which he teaches has enabled me to make the jump into the Web Development world.

Throughout the course we covered many tools and technologies including:
-HTML5
-CSS3
-JavaScript
-Bootstrap 4
-SemanticUI
-DOM Manipulation
-jQuery
-Unix(Command Line) Commands
-NodeJS
-NPM
-ExpressJS
-REST
-MongoDB
-Database Associations
-Authentication
-PassportJS
-Authorization


This course is also unique in the way that it is structured and presented. Many online courses are just a long series of "watch as I code" videos.  This course is different and incorporates everything Mt. Steele has learned in his years of teaching to make this course not only more effective but more engaging. The course includes:

-Lectures
-Code-Alongs
-Projects
-Exercises
-Research Assignments
-Slides
-Downloads
-Readings
-Many pictures of his dog Rusty
