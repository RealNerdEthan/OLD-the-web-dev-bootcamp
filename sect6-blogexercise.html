		<h2>This Is My First Article</h2>
		<p class="first_paragraph">It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures to satiate desires both subtle and gross; but it's not for the timid. Insufficient facts always invite danger. Humans do have an amazing capacity for believing what they choose -- and excluding that which is painful.</p>
		<p>Leave bigotry in your quarters; there's no room for it on the bridge. A species that enslaves other beings is hardly superior -- mentally or otherwise. Now, I don't pretend to tell you how to find happiness and love, when every day is a struggle to survive.</p>
		<p>But I do insist that you do survive, because the days and the years ahead are worth living for!  Make It So! You’ve never really faced death, have you?” “...No; not like this.

		<h2>This Is Another Article</h2>
		<p class="first_paragraph">If we're going to be damned, let's be damned for what we really are. A lie is a very poor way to say hello. Human beings do not survive on bread alone ... but on the nourishments of liberty. </p>
		<p>For what indeed is a man without freedom ... naught but a mechanism, trapped in the cogwheels of eternity.</p>
		<p>It's time you learned that freedom is never a gift. It has to be earned. Beam Me Up, Scotty! Do you know the old Klingon proverb that revenge is a dish best served cold? It is very cold — in space.</p>
