<!-- 
These are the 5 Primitive Data Types (syntax agnostic)

//Numbers (JavaScript does care if it's a whole number, decimal, or negitive) (numbers in JS follow the order or operations like all other math)
4
9.3
-10

    -Modulo Numbers (remainder operator)
    10 % 3
    24 % 2

//Strings (are inside of "" which makes 1 string)
"Hello World"
"43"

    -Strings can be done in single '' or double ""
    -Cancatenation is "charlie" + "brown" = "charlie brown"
    -Escape characters start with "\" ("Singing \"do da de\" ")
    -Strings have a length property ("hello world".length = 11)
    -Access individual characters using [] and an index ("hello"[0] = "h"  or  "hello"[4] = o)
    -JS indexs at 0 (0, 1, 2, 3 and so on)

//Booleans
true
false

//null and undefined (these are values, not a category like booleans)
null
undefined

 <!-- 
Variables

//Variables are simply containers that store values
//They follow this pattern:
var yourVariableName = yourValue;

//They can store all of the values we've seen
var name = "Rusty";
var secretNumber = 73;
var isAdorable = true;

//Recall the stored value by calling the variable name
var name = "Rusty";
"hello there " + name    //"hello there Rusty"

var num = 37;
num + 3 + 10    //50

//We can also update existing variables
var name = "Robert";
name = "Bob";

 <!-- 
Null and Undefined
//The two other primitives are null and undefined

//Variables that are declared but not 
//initialized are undefined
//The following variables are undefined:
var name;
var age;

//null is "explicitly nothing"
var currentPlayer = "charlie";
currentPlayer = null;   //game over
